# Load Testing Runbook

Repeatable capacity tests for the expected workloads (issue #110): 10
concurrent users as a sustained interactive workload, 100 concurrent users as a
bounded burst, plus reservation-contention correctness.

The harness lives in `tests/load/` and talks to the app **exactly like a
browser**: SSR page loads and SvelteKit remote-function calls with cookies
(better-auth sessions, anonymous-visitor cookies). Direct DB access is used
only for fixtures, statement counts, and integrity verification.

## Scenarios (REQ-3)

| Scenario                         | What it does                                                            |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `page:anonymous-view`            | Anonymous SSR load of the shared arena wishlist `/w/loadtest-arena`     |
| `page:authed-view`               | The same page with a logged-in loadtest account (also exercises follow) |
| `command:createGift`             | `createGift` on the VU's own draft wishlist                             |
| `command:reserveGift-distinct`   | Each VU reserves (then releases) its **own** single-unit gift           |
| `command:reserveGift-contention` | All VUs race for the final unit of **one** gift — exactly one must win  |

## Profiles (REQ-4)

| Profile        | Shape                                                                                             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `smoke`        | 2 VUs, one pass through every scenario — endpoint sanity                                          |
| `sustained-10` | 10 VUs, mixed interactive loop with think time (default 120 s)                                    |
| `burst-100`    | 100 VUs, bounded burst: view + distinct reserve/release + creates, then a 100-way contention race |
| `contention`   | Pure final-unit race (default 10 VUs)                                                             |

## Reports (REQ-5)

Each run writes `tests/load/reports/<timestamp>-<profile>.{json,md}`
(gitignored) containing: p50/p95/p99/max latency per operation, dynamic request
count, DB statement count (pg_stat_statements delta), HTTP 4xx/5xx, Cloudflare
Worker resource-limit outcomes (error codes **1102**/**1027** parsed from
error bodies), reservation-integrity results (over-reservation query +
contention winners), and a pass/fail verdict. The runner exits non-zero when
acceptance fails.

## Data isolation (REQ-6)

Fixtures are dedicated rows: `loadtest-` prefixed ids, `@loadtest.invalid`
emails (undeliverable by definition), a dedicated arena wishlist, and per-VU
wishlists. Rows the app creates during a run (reservations, sessions, follows,
notifications, created gifts) are identified through their FKs to loadtest
rows. `pnpm loadtest:cleanup` deletes **only** these and cannot touch real
user rows.

## Running locally

```bash
pnpm db:start            # local Postgres (compose enables pg_stat_statements)
pnpm db:migrate          # schema (or db:push for a dev-iterated DB)
pnpm loadtest:setup      # idempotent fixtures (100 VU accounts + arena)
pnpm run dev             # in a second terminal; open the MPX-assigned localhost app URL

pnpm loadtest --profile smoke
pnpm loadtest --profile sustained-10 --duration 120
pnpm loadtest --profile burst-100
pnpm loadtest --profile contention

pnpm loadtest:cleanup    # remove all loadtest rows
```

Use the MPX-assigned app URL on `localhost`. For a non-default checkout or worktree,
pass that exact URL to the load test, for example:

```bash
pnpm loadtest --url http://localhost:8405 --profile smoke
```

On an existing container created before the compose change, enable statement counts
once with:

```bash
docker exec <db-container> psql -U root -d local -c "ALTER SYSTEM SET shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements';"
docker restart <db-container>
```

(Without it, reports show `DB statements: n/a` and everything else still works.)

## Running against a preview (Workers runtime)

```powershell
pnpm run build
pnpm run preview         # wrangler dev on :4173, local bindings
pnpm loadtest --target preview --profile smoke
```

`ORIGIN` must match the target origin for logins to succeed (better-auth
rejects mismatched origins outside the dev trusted list).

## Running against production — explicit authorization only (AC-8)

A production run touches the live Worker, live Neon, and free-tier quotas
(100k req/day Workers; the burst profile issues ~500 dynamic requests, logins
count toward better-auth rate limits). It is disabled unless **both** guards
are provided:

```powershell
$env:LOADTEST_ALLOW_PRODUCTION = "I_UNDERSTAND_THIS_RUNS_AGAINST_PRODUCTION"
# Optional but recommended — Neon *direct* URL, enables fixtures/integrity/statement metrics:
$env:LOADTEST_DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://USER:PASS@HOST/db?sslmode=require"

pnpm loadtest:setup      # fixtures on the production DB (loadtest- rows only)
pnpm loadtest --target production --allow-production --profile sustained-10
pnpm loadtest:cleanup    # ALWAYS clean up afterwards
```

Notes for production runs:

- Fixture setup/cleanup refuse non-local databases without the env guard; the
  runner refuses non-local URLs without `--allow-production` **and** the env.
- Without `LOADTEST_DATABASE_URL`, DB-dependent features (fixtures reset,
  statement counts, integrity queries) are skipped and the report says so —
  client-observed contention correctness still verifies.
- Statement counts include every client of the database; run when otherwise
  idle for meaningful numbers.
- better-auth rate-limits sign-in in production; the harness staggers logins
  (5 at a time, retries) — prefer `sustained-10` over `burst-100` there.

## Acceptance mapping (issue #110)

- **10-user scenario, zero 5xx/1102/1027/integrity errors** → `sustained-10`
  verdict.
- **100-user burst, zero over-reservation + percentile/request/statement
  report** → `burst-100` verdict + report file.
- **Exactly one successful reservation under contention** → `contention` /
  burst phase B verdict (client-observed successes + DB active-reservation
  count).
- **Cleanup without touching real rows** → `loadtest:cleanup` (prefix/FK
  scoped).
