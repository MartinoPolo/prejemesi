# Production operations

Operational runbook for `prejemesi` on Cloudflare Workers, Hyperdrive/Neon, R2,
and Resend. Dashboard configuration is account-side work: verify each control in
production; this document does not claim it is already enabled.

## Telemetry and privacy

### Dashboard paths

Workers Logs Free retains 200,000 log events/day for three days. Configure
production for 10% head sampling (`head_sampling_rate: 0.1`) and custom events.
Keep automatic invocation logs disabled because they include the raw request URL
and could retain reset, invitation, or authentication tokens from query strings.

Retain only these custom records:

- `phase: start`: SvelteKit route ID, method, deployment version.
- `phase: complete`: SvelteKit route ID, method, status, outcome, duration in
  milliseconds, deployment version.

Use route templates such as `/w/[id]`, never the concrete path. Never log raw
URLs or query strings, request/response bodies, headers, cookies, credentials,
tokens, email addresses, names, uploaded content, database statements, or form
values. `deploymentVersion` identifies the deployed Worker version, not a Git
secret or user. The privacy tradeoff is deliberate: a killed invocation may
have only a sampled start record. Classify its platform outcome in Workers
Metrics, then correlate by UTC time, deployment version, and route start.

For every incident, record: UTC start/end, client-visible code, Metrics outcome,
affected route ID, deployment version, request/error counts, mitigation, and
recovery time. Use this telemetry for application exceptions, platform limits,
and edge mitigation. Use Sentry for retained application stack traces and
proactive notifications; keep Cloudflare telemetry for platform outcomes and
resource-limit diagnosis.

### Sentry

The production deployment requires the following GitHub `production`
environment settings:

- Variable `PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN`: public runtime DSN used by the browser and Worker.
- Variable `SENTRY_ORG`: source-map organization slug, `martin-poloch`.
- Variable `SENTRY_PROJECT`: source-map project slug, `prejemesi` (display name `Prejemesi`).
- Secret `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`: build-only token with release/source-map upload permission.

The deployment fails before building if any setting is absent and is the only
workflow that enables source-map uploads. `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` must never be
placed in Worker variables, client code, logs, or committed files. The build
release and Worker runtime release are both the deployed Git commit SHA,
allowing Sentry to resolve minified production frames with the matching
uploaded source maps.

Error events disable user identity, cookies, headers, query parameters, HTTP
bodies, database values, and stack-frame variables. Additional event filtering
removes user objects, request details beyond method and path, sensitive custom
keys, and email addresses. Session Replay is enabled during the Sentry trial for
10% of sessions and all sessions containing a captured error; all text and inputs
are masked, user-facing and link/source/value attributes are masked, hidden inputs and media are
blocked, and network bodies and headers are not recorded. Replays stop and are
discarded on authentication routes, token-bearing routes, and URLs with query
strings. Error-triggered buffering resumes after navigation back to a safe route;
regular session sampling resumes on the next page load. Review the sampling
rates and retained data before the trial ends.

Configure an issue alert in Sentry for new and regressed `error` or `fatal`
issues in the `production` environment, then verify the notification recipient.
After deployment, create one controlled browser error and one authenticated
Worker error, confirm both issues use the deployed release and readable source
maps, inspect the associated replay for masking, and remove the test trigger.
Do not expose a permanent public error-generation route.

## Resource-limit incident procedure

1. Preserve evidence: note UTC window, deployment version, affected route, and
   the Cloudflare Ray ID shown to the client, if available. Do not paste tokens,
   emails, form data, or request bodies into the incident record.
2. Open Worker **Metrics**, select the window and version, then inspect Errors,
   invocation outcomes, CPU, memory, and request count. Correlate sampled safe
   logs and Hyperdrive Metrics for the same window.
3. Classify with the table below. If uncertain, reduce abusive/expensive traffic
   first, preserve the current production data, and then investigate.
4. After mitigation, repeat the affected flow and watch the same dashboards for
   at least 15 minutes. Record recovery and follow-up work.

| Incident                    | Evidence                                                                                                                                                                                       | Immediate mitigation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CPU                         | Client `1102`; Metrics/Logs outcome `exceededCpu`; CPU spike on one route/version. Free limit: 10 ms CPU per invocation.                                                                       | Roll back the regressing version. Temporarily challenge/block the expensive route. Remove synchronous parsing/rendering or repeated work; move work behind I/O or split it. Upgrade only if the workload genuinely cannot fit after optimization.                 |
| Memory                      | Client `1102`; outcome `exceededMemory`; memory spike. Limit: 128 MB per isolate.                                                                                                              | Roll back. Stop the triggering upload/import route at the edge. Remove full-body/full-result buffering, stream or bound payloads, and reduce concurrent in-memory work before redeploying.                                                                        |
| Startup                     | Deploy fails with `10021`, including startup CPU or memory validation; limit: 1 second and 128 MB at top level.                                                                                | Existing good version remains the recovery target. Move expensive top-level initialization into lazy request scope, reduce imports/generated data, rebuild, and redeploy. Do not route traffic to the rejected version.                                           |
| Daily Worker requests       | Client `1027`; daily request graph reaches 100,000. Resets at `00:00 UTC`.                                                                                                                     | Stop crawlers/load tests, enable or tighten the WAF/rate rule, and remove request amplification. Keep fail-closed behavior for auth/data paths. If service must recover before reset, move to Workers Paid after confirming the traffic is legitimate.            |
| Daily Hyperdrive statements | Hyperdrive Metrics reaches 100,000 statements; DB-backed routes fail while non-DB responses may work. Every `SELECT`, mutation, DDL statement, and cached query counts. Resets at `00:00 UTC`. | Challenge/block the responsible route, stop load tests, reduce repeated reads/refresh cascades, and inspect cache/query count. Do not bypass Hyperdrive with an unreviewed production connection. Upgrade Workers if legitimate traffic must resume before reset. |

Cloudflare `Exceeded Resources` can aggregate CPU, memory, startup, and daily
limits. Do not classify from that label alone; use the specific outcome/code,
deployment status, quota graph, and correlated route record. Check
[Cloudflare Status](https://www.cloudflarestatus.com/) before attributing an
`internalError` spike to application code.

## Edge protection

### WAF bot-probe rule

Free supports five custom WAF rules and no regular expressions. Use one custom
rule named `Block common bot probes`, action **Block**, with this case-insensitive
expression. It mirrors the fallback guard in `src/hooks.server.ts` exactly:

```text
(lower(http.request.uri.path) eq "/xmlrpc.php") or
(lower(http.request.uri.path) eq "/.env") or
(lower(http.request.uri.path) eq "/phpinfo.php") or
starts_with(lower(http.request.uri.path), "/wp-") or
starts_with(lower(http.request.uri.path), "/wp/") or
starts_with(lower(http.request.uri.path), "/wordpress/") or
starts_with(lower(http.request.uri.path), "/phpmyadmin") or
starts_with(lower(http.request.uri.path), "/pma/") or
starts_with(lower(http.request.uri.path), "/.git/")
```

Verification:

1. Request `/xmlrpc.php?probe=<UTC timestamp>` and one prefixed path such as
   `/wp-admin?probe=<UTC timestamp>`. Expect the Cloudflare block response.
2. Confirm both matches in **Security > Events** at that UTC time.
3. Search Worker Observability for the same time and route. There must be no
   custom record with `phase: start` or `phase: complete`: WAF ran before Worker
   invocation. Also confirm Worker request count did not increase for the probes.
4. Request `/` and one public `/w/<test-id>` path to confirm ordinary traffic is
   unaffected. Retain the in-app guard as defense in depth.

### One Free rate-limit rule

The Free plan permits one rate-limiting rule. Configure exactly one rule named
`Protect dynamic Worker traffic`:

| Setting                 | Value                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Match                   | Path starts with `/api/` **OR** `/_app/remote/`; **AND Verified Bot is false**                                               |
| Expression              | `(starts_with(http.request.uri.path, "/api/") or starts_with(http.request.uri.path, "/_app/remote/")) and not cf.client.bot` |
| Counting characteristic | IP                                                                                                                           |
| Threshold               | 20 requests per 10 seconds                                                                                                   |
| Action                  | Managed Challenge                                                                                                            |
| Mitigation timeout      | `0` (challenge/throttle mode required on Free)                                                                               |

Twenty requests/10 seconds/IP is a starting hypothesis, not measured capacity.
It covers BetterAuth, upload/API, and SvelteKit remote-function traffic without
counting ordinary page/static-asset requests. Shared NAT users still share the
IP counter, so validate before lowering it.

Verification:

1. From one browser/IP, complete normal interactive flows: sign in, open a
   wishlist, reserve/unreserve a test gift, and upload a permitted test image.
   No challenge should interrupt ordinary use.
2. From a test client/IP, send one controlled burst above 20 matching requests
   within 10 seconds. Excess requests should receive a Managed Challenge; stop
   after confirming it once. Do not use production data mutations for the burst.
3. Confirm the match in **Security > Events**, then confirm fewer excess requests
   reached Worker Metrics/Logs. Complete the challenge, then confirm ordinary
   interactive requests succeed again.
4. Review false positives and peak legitimate per-IP rate after 24 hours and one
   week. Raise the threshold if ordinary use is challenged; lower only with
   measured headroom and repeat this verification.

## Turnstile

Protect registration, password sign-in, magic-link request, password-reset request, and
anonymous reservation. The widget is only the client signal; every protected server
operation must enforce Siteverify before email, database, or reservation work.

1. In **Turnstile > Add widget**, create a Managed widget for `prejemesi.cz`
   (and `www.prejemesi.cz` while it remains a routed hostname). Copy sitekey and
   secret separately.
2. Set `PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` as a non-secret deploy variable. Store
   `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` only as a Cloudflare secret:

    ```powershell
    pnpm exec wrangler secret put TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY
    ```

    `wrangler.jsonc` sets `keep_vars: true`, so deployments preserve the
    dashboard-managed site key and secrets.

3. Render the widget on all five protected surfaces and submit its token with
   the form/remote-function payload.
4. On the server, call
   `POST https://challenges.cloudflare.com/turnstile/v0/siteverify` with the
   secret and token. Require `success: true`. The Turnstile widget hostname
   allowlist constrains token issuance to the production domains. Reject missing,
   invalid, expired, or replayed tokens before side effects.
5. Tokens expire after five minutes and are single-use; reset the widget after
   an error. Never expose or log the secret or token. Use Cloudflare's documented
   test keys outside production.
6. Verify each surface accepts one valid token and rejects missing, malformed,
   expired, and replayed tokens. Confirm failed validation creates no user,
   email, reset request, or reservation. Check Turnstile Analytics without
   copying personal form fields into logs.

## Smart Placement experiment

Smart Placement is an experiment, not a permanent default until measured.

1. Before enabling, record UTC window, deployment version, placement status,
   representative DB-backed routes, request volume, custom-log duration
   p50/p95/p99, error rate, and Hyperdrive query/connection latency. Use a normal
   traffic window that can be repeated.
2. Enable **Workers & Pages > prejemesi > Settings > General > Placement > Smart**
   (or deploy `placement.mode: "smart"`). Record the new deployment version.
3. Send consistent, representative traffic for at least 15 minutes. Include the
   same login, dashboard, public wishlist, and reservation reads used for the
   baseline; avoid quota-consuming stress traffic.
4. Check placement status. `SUCCESS` means analyzed;
   `INSUFFICIENT_INVOCATIONS` needs more consistent traffic;
   `UNSUPPORTED_APPLICATION` means Cloudflare detected regression and reverted.
5. In Worker Metrics, compare request-duration analytics for placed traffic with
   the 1% unplaced control, plus the same-route before/after p50/p95/p99, errors,
   and Hyperdrive latency. Keep Smart only if error rate does not rise and request
   duration is no worse, with a repeatable improvement. Disable it and redeploy
   on any sustained request-duration or error regression.
6. Record the decision below. Never replace `Pending` with a result until the
   production deployment and measurement actually occurred.
