# Hover hit-region stability (issue #346)

## Observed baseline

The fault was reproduced with Chromium's real browser zoom at 100%, 125%, and 150%, at every
supported depth (`soft`, `ink`, `black`). A pointer held at the lower hard-shadow edge produced more
than 100 hover-state transitions in a 650 ms sample on affected controls. Slow bottom-to-top sweeps
also found genuine unhovered bands between the shadow and face. Baseline metrics and representative
screenshots are retained under `docs/evidence/issue-346/baseline/`.

## Invariant

A raised interaction has two explicit layers:

- `.elevation-owner` is the stationary native semantic element. It owns hover, focus, refs,
  attributes, state, and event handlers and is never transformed.
- Its direct `.elevation-surface` child owns border, background, shadow, and motion.
- `.elevation-owner-raised::after` is a static transparent hit strip contiguous with the owner's
  lower border box and covering the resting ordinary-shadow offset. It never transforms or animates.
- Gift cards put all visible card content, overlays, and nested actions inside the direct moving
  surface. Nested semantic actions move with that surface while keeping their own hit targets
  aligned.

Hover lifts only the surface by 2 px. Active feedback returns it to zero translation, scales it to
0.98, and uses the pressed shadow. Anchored-open triggers rest at zero translation. Disabled
controls are inert. Reduced motion keeps the surface at rest. Like sticker surfaces additionally
scale to 1.08.

Inverse transforms, counter-motion custom properties, JavaScript style synchronization, debounce,
CSS zoom, and utility-string parsing are intentionally absent.

## Audit

The contract is applied to shared Button and raised Select triggers, Sort and Grouping, depth
choices, Like sticker buttons, full-row gift links, dashboard wishlist cards/list rows, gift cards,
dialog close, account menu trigger, and reorder grips. Flat form selects and ghost/link/chip
presentations retain their existing flat treatment.

The focused Playwright suite verifies stationary lower-edge reachability, event counts, frame
samples, contiguous sweeps, nested controls, held press, activation, anchored-open behavior, and
real browser zoom/depth matrices. Its headed-browser tests run sequentially because concurrent
Chromium windows share the display pointer and can interfere with hover samples. Motion tests read
the visual surface while separately asserting the owner bounding box stays fixed.

## Evidence

- Baseline: `docs/evidence/issue-346/baseline/metrics.json`
- Baseline screenshots: `docs/evidence/issue-346/baseline/*.png`
- Passing owner/surface run: `docs/evidence/issue-346/after/metrics.json`
- Passing representative screenshots: `docs/evidence/issue-346/after/*.png`

The after evidence was regenerated from the six-test green run using the same headed Chromium
extension, DPR 2, 1602×1100 viewport, and real 100%/125%/150% browser zoom matrix. No Chromium
profile or evidence from the rejected inverse-motion attempt is retained.
