# Production gift ingestion

This is a purpose-specific, append-only machine integration for reviewed, versioned gift manifests. It is scoped to one configured wishlist and uses the same transactional gift creation and notification digest path as the UI.

## Setup and production rollout

Follow this order exactly:

1. **Establish the database safety checkpoint first.** In the Neon dashboard, verify that built-in history / Point-in-Time Restore is available and that its retention covers the rollout. There is no project-managed automatic backup. Before migration, create and retain a manual `pg_dump` snapshot using the direct Neon URL, and verify that the dump file is non-empty.
2. **Verify and migrate before dependent code is deployed.** Using the direct Neon URL from the ignored `.env.production`, run `pnpm db:verify:prod`. If it reports PENDING, review and explicitly authorize every listed migration, then run `pnpm db:migrate:prod -- --yes`. Run `pnpm db:verify:prod` again and require EXACT before approving deployment of code that reads the migrations. DRIFT blocks migration and deployment. Never use Hyperdrive, `db:push`, or seed.
3. **Deploy with ingestion disabled.** Keep at least one required ingestion setting absent so the endpoint cannot write. Deploy the dependent application code only after the migration completes.
4. **Verify the existing manual paths.** In production, add one gift through the normal UI and then add a small bulk/import batch. Using a non-actor follower account, verify that both paths create/coalesce the expected single and bulk new-gift digest behavior before enabling machine ingestion.
5. Create a dedicated actor account and choose the single fixed target wishlist. Then configure Worker secret/variables `GIFT_INGESTION_TOKEN`, `GIFT_INGESTION_TARGET_SHORT_ID`, and `GIFT_INGESTION_ACTOR_ID`. Confirm the deployed Worker also has the `GIFT_INGESTION_RATE_LIMIT` binding declared in `wrangler.jsonc` (60 requests per 60 seconds). Missing endpoint values disable the endpoint; a missing or failing rate-limit binding fails closed with HTTP 503. Do not enable ingestion before the preceding checks pass.
6. Put `GIFT_INGESTION_TOKEN` and `GIFT_INGESTION_BASE_URL` in the ignored local file `.env.gift-ingestion.local`. The base URL is the allowlisted exact production origin: non-local HTTPS with no credentials, query, fragment, or non-root path.
7. Prepare a schema-version-1 manifest whose short ID, title, and recipient exactly match the fixed target. Every item must have at least one gift link, and `gift.links[0].url` must exactly equal its `sourceUrl`.
8. Run a dry-run and inspect the resolved short ID, title, recipient, every proposed item, warnings, skips, and conflicts. Stop on any identity mismatch, ambiguity, or conflict.
9. Apply one controlled, reviewed gift. Verify the created gift, provenance/audit result, mirrored image when present, and follower digest before proceeding.
10. Only after the controlled gift passes verification, process normal batches. Continue to dry-run and inspect every manifest before apply.

## Threat boundaries

`POST /api/internal/v1/gift-ingestion` is the only machine operation. The bearer token grants gift creation on only the configured wishlist. The endpoint cannot select another environment or destination and has no GET, update, or delete operation. It accepts bounded JSON only, validates HTTPS URLs, rejects archived targets, and does not use BetterAuth cookies. After token validation and before reading the body, it calls Cloudflare Workers Rate Limiting with a fixed non-secret endpoint key; denied requests return HTTP 429 without DB/R2 work. Invalid tokens never consume quota. Canonical source duplicates are advisory skips; manual UI duplicate behavior is unchanged.

The CLI sends its bearer token only to the exact production origin allowlisted by `GIFT_INGESTION_BASE_URL`; an explicit `--base-url` must normalize to that same origin. Database and R2 credentials remain inside deployed infrastructure. For selected images, the CLI enforces SSRF-safe HTTPS destinations (including DNS answers and every redirect), timeout and 5 MiB limits, JPEG/PNG/WebP/GIF signatures, declared/actual MIME agreement, and positive dimensions. It then asks the Worker for a manifest/item/hash-bound, short-lived presigned PUT and uploads directly to that exact URL. The CLI receives no R2 credential.

## Durable image protocol

Image mirroring is all-or-nothing for requested images. Preparation binds the key below `gifts/ingestion/` to wishlist, manifest, item, SHA-256 content hash, supported MIME, and byte length. Apply accepts only the server-issued capability fields, fetches the exact staged object and verifies key binding, byte length, content type, and SHA-256 before storing `imageKey` with default automatic image metadata and atomically retaining each validated manifest item's bounded provenance in `gift_ingestion_item.provenance`. Rendering does not depend on retailer hotlinks.

Dry-run never downloads or mutates R2. Identical replay returns committed gift IDs without preparing, uploading, or deleting their images. Download, preparation, upload, or verification failure creates no gifts and triggers best-effort cleanup of staged objects. A failed gift/audit transaction is compensated after rollback; committed gift images are never cleaned. Cleanup failures create bounded `gift_ingestion_orphan` rows for operations follow-up.

## Dry-run

Dry-run is the default:

```bash
pnpm ingest:gifts --manifest ./gifts.json --base-url https://prejemesi.example
```

It reports the resolved identity, `wouldCreate`, `alreadyApplied`, `skipped`, warnings, and conflicts. It creates no gifts, audit rows, notifications, or uploads.

## Apply

Mutation requires both `--apply` and the allowlisted production origin as an explicit `--base-url`:

```bash
pnpm ingest:gifts --manifest ./gifts.json --apply --base-url https://prejemesi.example
```

Stop if dry-run reports a mismatch, ambiguity, or conflict. Apply is atomic: gift creation, notification digest coalescing, and ingestion audit/idempotency rows commit in one transaction. Identical item replay returns prior gift IDs; changed content under a reused item ID is rejected.

## Secret handling

Generate a unique high-entropy ingestion token. Store it as a Cloudflare Worker secret and in the ignored local env file only. Never place it in a manifest, prompt, shell output, repository file, browser cookie, screenshot, or log. Never reuse `AUTH_SECRET`, a BetterAuth cookie, Neon credentials, or R2 credentials. Rotate by replacing both copies; removing any required server configuration disables ingestion immediately.

## Rollback

Remove the ingestion token to stop machine writes. Do not delete successfully created gifts automatically. Keep audit and idempotency rows for diagnosis. Database changes are additive and should not be reversed by dropping production tables. If a gift itself must be removed, use the normal authorized UI and its lifecycle rules. Never remove committed gift images during rollback. Resolve only uncommitted keys listed in `gift_ingestion_orphan`; verify references before manual deletion.

## Prohibited model behavior

An automation model must never generate or execute SQL, connect to Neon/R2, request database or storage credentials, use BetterAuth cookies, choose an environment, redirect the destination wishlist, invent product identity or price, bypass dry-run, add update/delete instructions, print the token, or apply after a mismatch/conflict. It may create a reviewed manifest and invoke only the fixed CLI.
