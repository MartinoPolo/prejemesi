# Production Deployment Runbook

How a commit reaches the production Worker, and how schema changes ship safely
(issue #110). Provisioning and service setup live in `CLOUDFLARE_SETUP.md`.

## The gated pipeline

Merging `dev` → `production` (or a manual **Deploy (production)** dispatch)
triggers `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

1. **verify** — runs the full reusable check suite
   (`.github/workflows/checks.yml`, called with `run_e2e: true`) for the exact
   commit being deployed: formatting, oxlint, stylelint, fallow, svelte-check,
   eslint, migration safety, unit + browser-mode vitest, and the Playwright
   e2e suite against a Postgres service. A commit with any failing check never
   reaches the deploy job. (PRs and `dev` pushes run the same suite via
   `ci.yml`, also called with `run_e2e: true`, so e2e runs there too; this
   `verify` step re-runs it to pin the exact deployed commit.)
2. **migration-review** — validates the complete committed migration journal and SQL
   files, then writes a step summary. It has no production database credentials and
   therefore cannot prove that Neon is current. Its success is only a repository
   integrity check; production reconciliation remains mandatory for every release.
3. **deploy** — waits for the GitHub **`production` environment approval**
   (required reviewer: repo owner; restricted to the `production` branch).
   After approval it builds and runs `wrangler deploy`.

The deployed commit is recorded three ways: in the environment's deployment
history (GitHub → Environments → production), in the workflow step summary,
and as a `GIT_COMMIT_SHA` plain-text var on the Worker.

### PR and `dev` merge gate

Pull requests targeting `dev` (and `dev` pushes) run the reusable checks through
`ci.yml`, now called with `run_e2e: true` — so the full suite **including the
Playwright e2e job** runs on every PR and `dev` push. Branch protection requires
the stable `checks / required` aggregator, which fails if the static/unit checks
fail or (when `run_e2e: true`) if e2e fails. Feedback is slower than the old
e2e-skipped setup, but regressions are caught before the merge rather than only
at the production deploy gate.

If the reusable workflow's caller or aggregator job name changes, update the
branch protection status check on both `dev` and `production` at the same time.

Production protection also requires `checks / required`: release PRs
(`dev` → `production`) run `ci.yml` the same way, so the same aggregator gates
the merge. The production **push** then re-runs the suite through `deploy.yml`'s
`verify` job before the environment-approval deploy step. (Historically this
required `verify / required`, a status that only appears on the production push,
never on the release PR — so it could never be satisfied pre-merge; it was
repointed to `checks / required`.)

Production protection is **strict** (branch must be up to date) and applies to
admins, so every release PR opens as `BEHIND`: merging `dev` → `production`
leaves the merge commit only on `production`, so `dev` always lacks it by the
next release. Sync before merging — GitHub's **Update branch**, or:

```powershell
gh api -X PUT repos/MartinoPolo/prejemesi/pulls/<pr>/update-branch
```

This merges `production` back into `dev` and re-triggers the PR checks; do it
**before** waiting on CI so the suite runs once, on the final merged tree.
`BEHIND` here carries no unique content — verify with
`git diff origin/dev...origin/production` (expected: empty). Merge the release
with a **merge commit**, never squash: squashing rewrites the shared commits and
breaks the ancestry (see `b31fe5b`).

Environment approval is configured under
**Settings → Environments → production** (required reviewer + branch policy).
A missing reviewer or production-only branch policy is a release blocker: restore
both controls, verify them through the API, and start a new run that demonstrably
waits for approval. The controls can be recreated with:

```bash
gh api -X PUT repos/MartinoPolo/prejemesi/environments/production \
  --input .github/production-environment.json
gh api -X POST repos/MartinoPolo/prejemesi/environments/production/deployment-branch-policies \
  -f name=production -f type=branch
gh api repos/MartinoPolo/prejemesi/environments/production \
  --jq '{protection_rules, deployment_branch_policy}'
gh api repos/MartinoPolo/prejemesi/environments/production/deployment-branch-policies \
  --jq '.branch_policies[] | {name, type}'
```

The final command must list only the `production` branch policy. The tracked environment
payload intentionally keeps `prevent_self_review` disabled because the repository has a
single required reviewer; the separate exact-run authorization rule below prevents agents
from treating shared owner credentials as implicit approval.

The normal approval is a human action in GitHub. An agent authenticated as the
required reviewer can also approve through `gh`; GitHub cannot distinguish that
agent from the account owner. The agent may do so only after the user explicitly
authorizes the exact run and SHA after seeing the final migration evidence:

```bash
environment_id=$(gh api \
  repos/MartinoPolo/prejemesi/actions/runs/<run-id>/pending_deployments \
  --jq '.[0].environment.id')
gh api --method POST \
  repos/MartinoPolo/prejemesi/actions/runs/<run-id>/pending_deployments \
  -F "environment_ids[]=$environment_id" \
  -f state=approved \
  -f comment='Migration history EXACT for <production-sha>'
```

Without that exact authorization, the agent stops at the pending deployment and
provides its URL for the required reviewer to approve manually.

## Database gate: reconcile → migrate → verify → deploy

Migrations are intentionally **manual** and run against the **direct Neon URL**
(never through Hyperdrive, never `db:push`, never seeding). Reconcile production
before **every** deployment, including code-only hotfixes and manual dispatches.
A diff containing no new SQL does not prove that an earlier migration was applied.

Use a clean checkout at the exact production SHA. `.env.production` is gitignored,
so confirm that the checkout can read the existing file without printing or copying
its value into logs. The URL must be PostgreSQL, belong to Neon, use the direct
(non-`-pooler`) hostname, and match the production host/database fingerprint pinned in
the verifier. Credentials may rotate without changing that target identity.

```bash
pnpm db:verify:prod
```

The verifier validates the complete journal and SQL hashes, then compares them with
`drizzle.__drizzle_migrations`:

- **EXACT** — the database ledger exactly matches the target SHA; approval may proceed.
- **PENDING** — the database ledger is an exact prefix. Review every listed SQL file
  for compatibility with the currently running app, obtain migration authorization,
  then apply and verify:

    ```bash
    pnpm db:migrate:prod -- --yes
    pnpm db:verify:prod
    ```

- **DRIFT** — an applied hash/timestamp differs, history is reordered, or the ledger
  has unexpected rows. Stop; do not migrate or deploy until the discrepancy has an
  explicit recovery plan.

`db:migrate:prod` performs the same preflight, refuses PENDING work without `--yes`,
blocks DRIFT, runs Drizzle on the advisory-lock-owning PostgreSQL connection without a
child process, redacts database details from errors, and requires an EXACT postcondition.
It is safe as a no-op when already EXACT. A successful `migration-review` workflow job or local test database migration
is never a substitute for this production check.

Because migration runs while the previous app version is serving traffic, use the
expand → migrate → deploy → contract sequence:

1. **Expand** — additive migration only (new tables/columns, nullable or with
   defaults; backfills). Old app code must run unchanged against the new schema.
2. **Migrate and verify** — reach EXACT before approving the deployment.
3. **Deploy** — approve the environment gate; the new app version starts using
   the new schema shapes.
4. **Contract** — only in a later release, after the deployed app no longer reads
   the old objects: drop/rename in a separate migration.

Enforcement: `pnpm check:migrations` (part of `check:all` and CI) fails on
destructive statements (`DROP TABLE/COLUMN/TYPE`, `RENAME`, `TRUNCATE`,
`DELETE FROM`, `SET DATA TYPE`, `SET NOT NULL`) unless the migration tag has a
nonempty rationale in `drizzle/meta/contract-migrations.json`.

The acknowledgment stays outside the SQL because Drizzle records the exact SQL hash
in production. Never add a marker comment to an applied migration. The recipient-role
expand and contract migrations demonstrate the sequence and sidecar acknowledgment.

## Rollback

- **App only:** `wrangler rollback` (or re-run the deploy workflow from the
  previous production commit). Safe whenever the contract step has not run —
  which the sequence above guarantees for the current release.
- **Schema:** contract migrations are the only irreversible step; because they
  ship one release later, the previous app version always remains deployable.

## Production release checklist

- [ ] Target SHA and rollback Worker version recorded.
- [ ] Complete migration manifest passes `pnpm check:migrations`.
- [ ] Any new migration was generated via `pnpm db:generate`, reviewed, committed,
      and is expand-compatible (or a later contract is explicitly acknowledged).
- [ ] All declared Worker bindings are present in the built/deployed config. In particular,
      `GIFT_INGESTION_RATE_LIMIT` must show the 60 requests / 60 seconds policy; ingestion fails
      closed with HTTP 503 if the binding is absent or errors.
- [ ] Any **new env var/secret** the release reads is set on the Worker
      (`wrangler secret list` + `wrangler versions view <id>`). A missing one
      does not fail the deploy — the feature just silently stays off, which is
      how `ADMIN_EMAILS` sat unset from #150 until the #213 release.
- [ ] Sync the release PR (`update-branch`) — it opens `BEHIND` every time.
- [ ] Merge to `production` (merge commit, not squash); wait for **verify**.
- [ ] From the exact production SHA, run `pnpm db:verify:prod` for every release.
- [ ] If PENDING, review and authorize every listed migration, run
      `pnpm db:migrate:prod -- --yes`, and verify again.
- [ ] Record an **EXACT** result before approval.
- [ ] Obtain explicit approval for the exact run/SHA; an agent does not approve
      through shared owner credentials unless specifically authorized to do so.
- [ ] Verify: https://prejemesi.cz responds; `wrangler tail` shows no errors.
