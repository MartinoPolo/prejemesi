# Historical review feedback

**Latest decision:** Variant C is approved and finalized at `refined.html`; see `variants/DECISION.md` and `SUMMARY.md`. The following records the earlier rejected A/B review, not the current gate status.

Neither Variant A nor Variant B is accepted. Do not treat references to those variants as a selection for batch refinement.

The broad preview obscured the actual action-geometry decision and introduced invalid image gaps, a separate Like header strip and oversized/misplaced reorder controls. Historical A/B differ only in mobile List browse action placement; desktop, Grid and reorder are identical.

Latest user direction:

- List images fill the complete row height while preserving the square thumbnail contract. These constraints apply together: width follows the row's inner height, so a taller content/action column makes the square image wider rather than leaving card background below it. Truncate description first, then title when needed.
- Keep price, quantity, store-link entry and every eligible action available; full descriptive text belongs in gift details.
- Grid Like overlays the image without reserving a white header band or reducing image height. Preserve ghost heart and adjacent count.
- Top-left reorder grip: small outlined visual inside a larger actionable area, with coherent nested corners.
- Button/card inset and corner direction is acceptable, but the overall gift specimen is not.

Focused replacement is now available at `variants/variant-c.html`, with its own `variants/variant-c-notes.md` guide: List actions, Grid overlays and top-left grips are separate sections. It includes a clearly labelled enlarged-text stacking proposal and a manager secondary-action stress case, both awaiting review. Do not ask the user to choose the obsolete A/B as if those layouts satisfied the full-height image requirement. No refined.html or SUMMARY.md should be generated until a replacement specimen is reviewed.
