# Gift Geometry Review — Design Summary

**Base:** Variant C · **Status:** Refined; action placement and desktop sizing revised after implementation review.

## Refinements Applied

The user initially approved the focused specimen, then rejected the implemented manager reservation overlay and oversized desktop footer actions. Reserve/cancel now belongs in the bottom action area beside Received and More when space permits, never over the image. Desktop actions use the existing compact Reserve control size; mobile retains larger touch targets. Narrow manager layouts may stack the square image and action content rather than overlay or clip controls. These corrections supersede the action placement and sizing shown in `refined.html`. Historical A/B remain retired. Requirements and geometry remain authoritative in the design brief.

## Implementation Notes

Keep native Svelte component behavior, server-derived capabilities and real persistence; do not ship the HTML fixture renderer, review tools, fake mutation timer or sample store domains. The local reorder arrows demonstrate position/focus only, not pointer drag or save correctness. Preserve all required priority/category badges in real compositions, including manager action cases; fixture omissions do not supersede issue requirements.

The 200% switch demonstrates an approved accessibility outcome, not a production-only manual switch. Production must respond to real enlarged text/available space and verify that reflow with browser zoom, font settings and the actual app gutters. The standalone review gutters are not a proposed page-shell change.

Use the existing image renderer's crop metadata, not a parallel CSS crop model. Keep recipient-sensitive data absent at the API and DOM boundaries. Verify runtime content, all eligible actions, localization, focus, shadows and real drag/scroll behavior in production components. The sourced concise auto-loaded geometry guidance in #362 remains implementation work.

## Handoff

Primary design: #350. Related visual requirements: #354, #356, #357, #360 and #362. #361 also uses the approved command design. All are design-ready, not implemented or closed. Issue descriptions identify their exact repository-relative refined mockup and brief paths. The handoff is published on `design/open-issue-review` for integration through a draft PR to `dev`.
