/**
 * `RESERVATION_CANCELLED` is dispatched from two different events (issue #213 reuses the type
 * rather than adding one): a BULK revert-to-draft that sweeps every reservation off a list
 * (issue #150), and a SINGLE release of one reservation by a správce/administrator. The email
 * body has to tell those apart, or a gifter reading „the list was unshared" about a list that is
 * still shared has been misinformed.
 *
 * The discriminator is the gift name: a single release always knows which gift it freed, a bulk
 * revert never names one because it cancels across the whole list.
