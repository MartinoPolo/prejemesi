# Deploy to Production

Run a gated release from remote `dev` to `production`. Treat `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`,
`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, and `scripts/migrate-prod.ts` as the sources of truth.
Use remote refs and an exact-SHA clean checkout so unrelated local changes never enter
the release. Never print credentials, connection URLs, tokens, or production data.

## 1. Qualify the Release

1. Read the three sources of truth above.
2. Fetch the remote and resolve the repository with `gh repo view --json nameWithOwner`.
3. Compare `origin/production..origin/dev` and inspect every changed path and commit.
    - If changes exist, continue with a `dev` → `production` release PR.
    - If no changes exist and the user explicitly requested a redeploy, pin the current
      `origin/production` SHA and use the manual-dispatch path below.
    - Otherwise stop: there is nothing to release.
4. Record the current production SHA and Worker version as the rollback target.
5. Run `pnpm check:migrations` at the candidate tree. Classify added `drizzle/*.sql`
   files, but never infer production database state from this diff. A modified or
   deleted existing migration is a blocker requiring a forward migration or explicit
   recovery plan.
6. Identify runtime variable and secret changes without reading or printing secret
   values. Verify every required name in the correct GitHub or Cloudflare scope. For
   identity-bearing settings such as `ADMIN_EMAILS`, confirm the intended production
   user exists and is eligible.
7. Confirm CI passed for the exact final candidate SHA.
8. Query the GitHub `production` environment and its branch policies:

    ```bash
    gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/environments/production \
      --jq '{protection_rules, deployment_branch_policy}'
    gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/environments/production/deployment-branch-policies \
      --jq '.branch_policies[] | {name, type}'
    ```

    Require a reviewer and exactly the `production` branch policy. Missing controls are
    a hard stop: restore them from `.github/production-environment.json`, verify both API
    responses, and require a new run to wait for approval.

Qualification is complete only when the report names the candidate SHA, rollback
target, commit/file delta, migration-file delta, manifest integrity result, required
configuration changes, green CI run, and verified environment gate. Production
migration status is deliberately still unknown until checked against Neon.

## 2. Stabilize the Release PR

1. Reuse the open `dev` → `production` PR or create one.
2. Confirm production contains no unique content; `git diff origin/dev...origin/production`
   must be empty before syncing.
3. If the PR is behind, update it:

```bash
gh api -X PUT repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr}/update-branch
```

4. Wait for checks on the final head SHA, then repeat release classification if syncing
   changed the tree.
5. Require the PR to be mergeable and every required check green.
6. Present the PR, final head SHA, user-visible scope, migration-file delta,
   configuration changes, rollback target, and expected production hold point. Obtain
   explicit confirmation before merging unless the user already authorized this exact
   release scope.
7. Provision authorized missing settings, then recheck their names and confirm the live
   `GIT_COMMIT_SHA` still identifies the recorded rollback version.

## 3. Fix the Production SHA and Hold Deployment

For a normal release:

1. Merge the release PR with a merge commit; never squash.
2. Fetch `origin/production` and record the resulting merge SHA.

For an explicitly requested redeploy with no source delta:

```bash
gh workflow run deploy.yml --ref production
```

Then:

1. Locate the `Deploy (production)` run for the exact production SHA.
2. Require `verify` and `migration-review` to succeed for that SHA.
3. Confirm `deploy` is waiting for production environment approval. If deployment
   started without a hold, treat the gate as broken, restore protection, and assess
   rollback before continuing.
4. Read the migration step summary. Its success validates committed files only; it
   does **not** prove that Neon is current.

## 4. Reconcile and Migrate Neon for Every Release

This gate applies to schema releases, code-only hotfixes, and manual redeployments.

1. Use a clean checkout at the exact production SHA. The current checkout is acceptable
   only if it is clean and already at that SHA; otherwise use a temporary isolated
   checkout. Make the gitignored `.env.production` available without echoing its
   contents, and remove any temporary credential copy during cleanup.
2. Confirm the file targets the direct Neon host. Never use a pooled `-pooler` URL,
   Hyperdrive, `db:push`, or seeding.
3. Run:

```bash
pnpm db:verify:prod
```

4. Act on the result:
    - **EXACT:** record the output and continue.
    - **PENDING:** record every listed tag. Review every corresponding SQL file against
      the currently running app, including pending migrations from earlier releases.
      Require expand compatibility and explicit authorization for the listed production
      mutation, then run:

        ```bash
        pnpm db:migrate:prod -- --yes
        pnpm db:verify:prod
        ```

        The second command must report **EXACT**.

    - **DRIFT:** stop. Do not migrate or approve. Investigate the hash/timestamp/order
      mismatch and obtain an explicit forward recovery plan.

A successful migrator exit without the final EXACT result is a failure. Never skip
this step because the current diff contains no new migration file.

## 5. Approve the Exact Deployment

Present the exact run URL/SHA, final **EXACT** migration result, configuration evidence,
and rollback target. The normal action is for the required reviewer to approve in
GitHub.

An agent authenticated through the owner's `gh` credentials must not approve by
default. GitHub cannot distinguish that agent from the owner. The agent may approve
only after the user explicitly authorizes the exact pending run and SHA after seeing
the final evidence. Then query the environment ID and approve:

```bash
environment_id=$(gh api \
  repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs/{run-id}/pending_deployments \
  --jq '.[0].environment.id')
gh api --method POST \
  repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs/{run-id}/pending_deployments \
  -F "environment_ids[]=$environment_id" \
  -f state=approved \
  -f comment='Migration history EXACT for {production-sha}'
```

If exact authorization is absent or the account cannot approve, provide the pending
run URL to the required reviewer and resume only after approval.

## 6. Verify the Release

1. Wait for workflow completion and inspect the deploy log for the Worker version and
   `GIT_COMMIT_SHA` assignment.
2. Require the GitHub environment deployment, live Worker version, Worker
   `GIT_COMMIT_SHA`, and workflow head to identify the same production SHA.
3. Confirm `https://prejemesi.cz` responds and exercise the smallest production smoke
   path covering the release. Do not create production users or mutate user data unless
   explicitly authorized.
4. Inspect a bounded `wrangler tail` window, Sentry, and relevant Cloudflare metrics
   for new errors without retaining tokens, query strings, identities, or request data.
5. Report the release PR or manual dispatch, production SHA, workflow URL, Worker
   version, migration result, smoke result, and rollback target.
6. Remove temporary credential copies/checkouts and confirm the original checkout was
   not changed.

## Rollback

If deployment or smoke verification fails, preserve the failing run URL and UTC window.
Select the recorded pre-release Worker version and obtain explicit rollback approval
unless rollback was already authorized. Roll back the app while leaving additive
migrations in place, then repeat identity, endpoint, smoke, and error checks. Contract
migrations are irreversible and belong only in a later release after the old app no
longer uses the contracted objects.
