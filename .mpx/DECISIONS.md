# Decisions

Current product, architecture, and design decisions for Přejeme si. Entries are grouped by subject
and sorted oldest to newest within each category; dates identify the decision or its latest
substantive revision, not implementation status. Superseded alternatives are retained only when they
prevent a likely regression. Read this whole file before implementation, including the design
sections for UI work. Historical reconciliation and review notes are in
[DECISIONS_REVIEW.md](DECISIONS_REVIEW.md).

## Product & lifecycle

- 2026-05-29: The app is called **Přejeme si**; it is a shareable family wishlist app, not a
  shopping or purchase-tracking service.
- 2026-05-29: An active wishlist is accessible to anyone holding its permanent `/w/<short-id>` link;
  there is no invite-only visitor mode. Manager invitations use separate one-time, revocable tokens.
- 2026-05-29: A gift is available or reserved, with no separate “bought” confirmation; quantity
  reservations claim units of the gift rather than creating duplicate gift entries.
- 2026-05-29: Likes express persistent interest and survive reservation; someone else reserving a
  liked gift notifies the liker rather than emailing every follower.
- 2026-05-29: Archiving is manual; a passed event date prompts rather than automatically archives.
  Archived wishlists are read-only, reject new reservations, and retain existing reservation
  visibility for authorized viewers.
- 2026-05-30: Gifts default to one unit, may have a finite quantity or be unlimited, and hide the
  quantity label when it is one; supported currencies are CZK (default), EUR, and USD.
- 2026-05-30: Wishlists start with high, medium, and low priorities; managers can rename or add
  levels and manually reorder gifts independently of priority.
- 2026-05-30: Logged-in visitors auto-follow on their first wishlist visit and can unfollow;
  Sledované retains unfollowed lists behind an off-by-default toggle with a follow-again action.
- 2026-06-03: Each gift stores up to ten ordered `{ url, label? }` links in `gift.links`; the first
  is primary, an omitted label falls back to the domain, and reservations and likes remain per gift.
- 2026-07-14: An active list can return to draft silently when reservation-free, but only a správce
  may do it; a reserved-list revert is admin-only, cancels reservations, and notifies reachable
  reservers. Recipients never get this control, including administrators acting as recipients.
- 2026-07-14: Reverting clears `sharedAt`, event-date locks, post-share badges, and description
  appends while preserving the original description, likes, and followers. Non-managers see “Seznam
  se připravuje”; re-sharing reuses the URL and starts fresh share grace. Unarchive before
  reverting.
- 2026-08-01: Ongoing, eventless wishlists are first-class alongside birthdays and Christmas; add
  the ongoing option without replacing concrete examples or occasion seed data. The optional
  event-date field remains directly available in creation, not hidden in advanced settings.
- 2026-09-12: A gift price may be a single estimate or a range; it hints at likely spending, not a
  binding or live-scraped shop price.

## Roles, privacy & trust

- 2026-05-30: Surprise protection is enforced by server-derived permissions and stripping
  reservation data from responses, with UI hiding as defense in depth; a client role flag is never
  the security boundary.
- 2026-07-08: Each wishlist has a linked-account or free-text **recipient** (obdarovaný) and
  **managers** (správci); UI English is “recipient” / “manager”, while code and database keep
  `moderator`. “For me” makes the creator the linked recipient; “for someone else” makes the creator
  the first správce.
- 2026-07-08: A linked recipient manages gifts, metadata, appearance, sharing, archive/delete, and
  správci, but normally sees no reservations, counts, likes, or gifter identities and cannot
  reserve. Správci have full management and reservation visibility and can also reserve.
- 2026-07-08: A linked recipient or any správce may invite and revoke správci; never remove the last
  správce of a free-text-recipient list. Moje seznamy contains linked-recipient lists, and
  Spravované contains lists managed for others.
- 2026-07-14: Only the linked recipient can change their own recipient identity to a free-text name:
  clear the account link, make that actor a normal správce, and reset the self-promotion flag.
  Shared lists notify followers that the actor now sees reservations; draft changes are silent,
  archived changes are rejected. The visible manager line replaces the old self-recipient banner.
- 2026-07-14: Správci can rename a free-text recipient but cannot evict or replace a linked
  recipient. Free-text-to-account linking happens through an explicit claim token, not account
  lookup at creation or direct linked-to-linked transfer.
- 2026-07-14: Any správce can issue a recipient claim link, optionally email it, and show a linking
  nudge. Claim requires sign-in, makes the account name canonical by clearing `recipientName`,
  grants recipient rights, and notifies správci in-app without email.
- 2026-07-14: Reject a recipient claim by anyone with active reservations or any post-share správce
  history, including soft-deleted assignments; flip-and-claim-back must not launder prior
  reservation visibility.
- 2026-07-14: App administrators are matched server-side against `ADMIN_EMAILS`, are not implicit
  správci, and never appear in manager lists. Expose narrowly computed capabilities rather than
  administrator identities; no admin override bypasses recipient surprise protection.
- 2026-07-19: Visitors see anonymous reserved state and their own reservation controls, not other
  gifters’ names; names are for správci and separately authorized admin reservation management.
  Reservation notifications omit the actor’s name. Do not treat possession of a share link as
  consent to expose account identities.
- 2026-08-12: Privileged single-reservation release retains issue #213 authorization: správci
  release guest reservations only, administrators can release any reservation, and recipients get
  neither override. Put release in the gift editor/detail, not routine card/list/compact browsing;
  an admin’s read-only detail remains an entry point.
- 2026-09-12: Explicit recipient self-promotion reveals reservation state and reservation/like
  counts, not gifter identities; the actor remains a recipient and cannot reserve, like, or use
  admin overrides on that list. Notify visitors and retain a permanent trust banner, including on
  migrated self-promoted lists; this narrows the old ambiguous “full state” wording.

## Post-share gift editing

- 2026-06-07: After sharing, recipients can edit images/crops, ordered links, price/currency, and
  priority uniformly across gifts; never gate these fields on reservation state. The gift name
  anchors what was reserved and freezes after initial grace; quantity may increase but never
  decrease from its current value, because reservation-based clamping would leak counts.
- 2026-06-07: Recipient edits notify through uniform visual disclosure, not per-edit emails: use
  `editedAfterShareAt` for “Upraveno po sdílení”, not `updatedAt`, which also changes on unrelated
  actions. Keep per-field diffs deferred.
- 2026-07-02: Share grace lasts two minutes for full editing of pre-share gifts; later edits never
  reopen name/delete grace. Gifts added after sharing have deletion grace only for two minutes from
  creation. Description appends and the event-date lock have independent grace windows; show the
  applicable countdown.
- 2026-07-02: The original shared description is preserved; later clarification is an immutable,
  accent-colored, dated append, editable/removable only during its own grace. If the original was
  empty, the first text may populate it. Cards, rows, and editors show the latest append with a
  full-history toggle rather than discarding the original.
- 2026-07-12: A byte-identical round trip to the snapshot captured before the first in-grace edit
  clears the post-share badge only inside share/creation grace. Compare against that original
  snapshot, not the immediately previous edit; after grace, even a revert is a visible change.
- 2026-09-12: Never delete a gift with active reservations, including during recipient
  share/creation grace; the user accepts the narrow inference from a blocked grace-period deletion
  to preserve reservations. Správci may delete unreserved gifts without recipient grace limits;
  resolve reservations through their authorized cancellation/release workflow first.

## Authentication, notifications & localization

- 2026-05-29: Anonymous visitors may browse and reserve without an account, supplying a required
  display name and optional email in the reservation modal alongside sign-in/register options; they
  have no dashboard or followed-list persistence.
- 2026-05-29: Use email for critical events and batched in-app notices for routine activity.
  Critical cases include a liked gift reserved by someone else, a reserved gift edited by a správce,
  archive, disclosed self-promotion, and manager invitations; recipient edits follow the separate
  no-email rule. No welcome email.
- 2026-05-29: Czech is primary and English is the only secondary locale, implemented with Paraglide;
  URL slugs are English, Czech routes are unprefixed, and English uses `/en/...`.
- 2026-05-30: Automatic email-based linking of anonymous reservations remains an intended
  requirement, not an implemented feature; do not describe sign-up as already recovering
  reservations. Identity-proof requirements must be settled before implementing ownership transfer.
- 2026-07-10: The language trigger is text “CZ” / “EN” plus chevron; drawn SVG flags appear only in
  menu items, never emoji flags that render as country letters on Windows. Locale switching uses
  client-side navigation after updating the locale cookie, not a document reload.
- 2026-07-16: Anonymous-reservation Turnstile is advisory when configuration or Siteverify is
  unavailable: allow and log those failures, but reject invalid/replayed tokens and a missing token
  when the configured check is running. Do not disable the client indefinitely when the widget
  cannot load; do not deploy test keys as protection.
- 2026-07-17: Explicit signed-in locale changes persist the user preference. Notification emails and
  internal links resolve the recipient’s current stored locale at dispatch, falling back to Czech
  for missing preferences or unmatched email-only recipients; never borrow the sender/request
  locale. Auth-email locale behavior is separate.
- 2026-08-01: Czech UI uses **vykání** everywhere and avoids em-dashes in visible copy; use commas,
  colons, or spaced en-dashes. Enforce formal address with `check:vykani`.
- 2026-08-23: New gifts produce at most one in-app digest per notified user per rolling 24-hour
  window, globally across followed wishlists and shared by manual creation, import/batch, and
  ingestion. Accumulate a hidden digest until the window closes, respecting preferences and
  excluding the actor/linked recipient; link a single-list digest to that wishlist and a multi-list
  digest to `/followed`. No digest email or scheduled Worker is required.
- 2026-08-28: Localized landing pages have canonical and `cs`/`en`/`x-default` alternates.
  Bearer-link wishlists emit `noindex, nofollow, noarchive` but retain Open Graph/Twitter previews;
  no wishlist sitemap without an explicit revocable publication mode. Auth and personal app pages
  remain unindexed.
- 2026-09-06: BetterAuth provides email/password and optional Google sign-in, email verification,
  and password reset; magic-link sign-in is removed from both UI and backend. Preserve accounts,
  sessions, and shared verification storage; former magic-link users establish a password through
  reset.

## Navigation & overview

- 2026-05-30: Desktop uses a top navbar, not a persistent sidebar; mobile uses a drawer. The three
  section links are Moje seznamy, Spravované, and Sledované, with click navigation and hover
  recent-list menus containing “Zobrazit vše”, not creation or archive actions.
- 2026-05-30: Personal list pages support card and list views, reservation progress only for
  authorized followed/managed views, and an off-by-default archived toggle; archived items are
  dimmed and sort below active items.
- 2026-05-30: Keep page title and ordinary page-toolbar actions together, use labeled sorting where
  space permits, and show Google profile images with an initials fallback.
- 2026-07-10: Navigation hover/active state is a background pill, not an underline. Landing desktop
  navigation uses section anchors; mobile landing controls consolidate into a popover rather than a
  hamburger. Mobile app appearance/language controls live in the drawer.
- 2026-08-07: `/home` (“Přehled” / “Overview”) is the signed-in root redirect, default post-auth
  destination, and logo target, preserving explicit auth redirects. Keep it out of desktop section
  navigation but first in the mobile drawer; the old “no dashboard” rejection no longer applies.
- 2026-08-07: Overview uses horizontal, next-card-peeking carousels on desktop and mobile: Nedávné,
  then Sledované → Spravované → Moje seznamy; omit empty rows and archived lists. Reuse WishlistCard
  rather than inventing a dense overview identity; category rows end with “Zobrazit vše”. New users
  with no lists see a create-first-list hero and shared-link following explanation.
- 2026-08-07: Category overview rows sort upcoming dates first, undated lists by recent visit with
  creation fallback next, and past unarchived events last. Nedávné mixes roles by `lastVisitedAt`,
  including own-list visits, with follow-date cold-start fallback and no deduplication against
  category rows.

## Wishlist browsing & actions

- 2026-05-30: Visitors are the primary wishlist design audience. Offer Card, List, and image-free
  Compact views with the same role-appropriate data; manual manager order is the default sort,
  alongside priority, price, name, and creation date with primary/secondary criteria.
- 2026-05-30: Source links are immediately accessible in every gift view as an external-link
  affordance and readable label/domain, not hidden in detail; no-link gifts show muted “Bez odkazu”.
  Multiple links stay with the gift content, and quantity is beside the title; only authorized
  viewers see the reserved portion.
- 2026-07-10: The wishlist header is a spiral notebook with a taped, square polaroid and a desktop
  sticky-note countdown; narrow layouts use a countdown chip, no date hides it, and passed dates
  show “proběhlo”. Do not stack a separate full-bleed hero above it.
- 2026-07-10: Show one lifecycle status chip and a direct Share action, opening the wizard at
  copy-link after sharing; remove redundant full-width shared/draft strips. Manager reservation
  reassurance is calm, while a self-promoted recipient’s trust warning is prominent, untaped, and
  persistent.
- 2026-07-14: Every wishlist header says “Pro: {name}” in nominative above the title; the polaroid
  caption is event date only or absent. Show all správci, including a self-promoted recipient, in
  “Spravuje/Spravují”; OG prose remains “Seznam přání pro {name}”. Do not duplicate recipient labels
  on self-list dashboard cards.
- 2026-07-15: Use shared filter controls with removable active pills on desktop; narrow layouts show
  an active count and clear action instead of pills. Role/auth gates remain intact; later mobile
  Display-sheet rules override the old anchored-dropdown placement.
- 2026-08-07: Pin the viewer’s own reservations under “Vaše rezervace” without duplicating gifts.
  Visitors then see available before fully reserved gifts with no redundant reserved-section
  heading; správci keep the own-reservation pin but do not sink other reservations. Recipient-only
  ordering never depends on reservation state; selected sorting applies inside each band, with
  received gifts final.
- 2026-08-07: Card and list reserved overlays share the full-text “Rezervováno” sticker, crisp above
  the image veil and dimmed content; správci additionally see names. Do not replace that signal with
  an ambiguous check-only icon.
- 2026-08-12: Received/unreceived is the primary manager browse action; marking received keeps the
  gift visible by enabling the received filter. Fully reserved gifts do not need a redundant
  disabled reserve button; privileged release belongs in detail/editor.
- 2026-08-13: View mode is global per device; sorting and mutually exclusive grouping (`none`,
  `priority`, `category`) persist per wishlist per device; filters reset each visit. Grouping is a
  visible display control, not a filter.
- 2026-08-13: Category/priority checkbox facets OR values within each facet and AND across facets;
  offer no-value options only when present. Priority groups follow priority order, category groups
  follow manager order, and “Bez priority” / “Bez kategorie” are last. Apply sorting within sections
  without losing reservation/received bands.
- 2026-09-04: Mobile Display is one stable, labeled bottom sheet switching sort/group/filter
  sections in place. Selection exposes count plus right-grouped Select all, Actions, Cancel; bulk
  Actions is non-cascading and retains mixed/loading/disabled/pending states. Reorder exposes a
  label and right-grouped Done.
- 2026-09-04: Wishlist sheets have shared top/side bounds, rounded corners, and safe-area clearance
  through a derived surface, not a global Sheet rewrite. Segmented controls use an accent tray with
  strong ink only around the selected item: 40 px mobile, 32 px from `sm`. Keep the mobile 40 px
  tilted logo and core wordmark; only `.cz` may collapse.
- 2026-09-07: Without a saved grouping, derive priority grouping when loaded gifts have priorities,
  otherwise none; do not persist this fallback. Preserve saved valid choices while data is pending;
  only loaded data may disable unavailable grouping and coerce it to none (#363).
- 2026-09-09: Gift primary/Received/More actions share a right-aligned footer lane in every
  role/state; Reserve/Cancel belongs there too, never as a manager action over the image. Keep
  adjacent controls equal-height, desktop actions compact, and mobile touch targets generous without
  clipping or losing shadow clearance.
- 2026-09-10: Use View plus one combined Display control on desktop and mobile, replacing separate
  sort/group/filter toolbar triggers. Put the Settings gear in the hero beside a distinct icon-only
  More, without duplicating Settings in its menu. Keep mobile browse chrome one row, Add gift
  direct/primary/rightmost, and eligible secondary actions in More, with batch add lowest priority.
- 2026-09-10: Desktop Display/bulk categories use adjacent cascading dropdowns with their parent
  menus still visible; mobile uses labeled bottom sheets, not desktop dropdowns or cascades.
  Equivalent overflow triggers behave consistently within each viewport. Switching an available
  sibling control closes the old surface and opens the new one in one action.
- 2026-09-11: List gifts are bordered cards with full-height square image columns; width may grow
  with row height while preserving the 1:1 crop. Truncate description before title, preserve
  price/quantity/link/all eligible actions, and stack image/content when enlarged text or narrow
  manager layouts require it; never solve overflow by clipping actions or leaving an image-bottom
  gap.
- 2026-09-12: Keep active mobile filter pills inside the Display sheet with Reset next to its Filter
  selector, not in another sticky toolbar row. The closed toolbar may show the count; this resolves
  the September 10 request for visible active filters without increasing sticky height.
- 2026-09-14: Image-bearing Card/List views share eligible category, priority, received/reserved,
  and authorized reservation-identity overlays across desktop/mobile, including image placeholders;
  assigned categories go top-left and reservation identity stays with its state overlay, not
  duplicated in the content column. Authorized viewers may see a single reserver's name; multiple
  reservers use a localized generic summary instead of listing names. Preserve server-derived
  privacy capabilities and keep Compact image-free. Validate crowded valid states in focused mockups
  before implementation.
- 2026-09-14: Grid/List gift titles use 18 px mobile / 24 px desktop, at most two lines then
  ellipsis, with the full title available through gift detail and accessible naming. Keep applicable
  quantity outside the clamp alongside the title. Grid quantity centers against the visible title
  block, and Grid Like uses the image/card top-right with a separate wrapping category lane. List
  quantity and Like center against the first title line even when the title wraps, using
  typography-derived alignment slots rather than arbitrary offsets. Preserve the ghost heart/count,
  accessible target and consistent title-to-price spacing. Top-align content at its ordinary inset
  rather than vertically centering it; equalize cards within each grid row. Received uses full ink
  secondary, distinct from Reserve and stronger than More, through shared semantic intents.
- 2026-09-14: Center gift state badges and authorized identity as one combined group on the image; a
  lone state remains at its center, independent of edge badges. Category stays top-left and priority
  bottom-left, as finalized in the gift-hierarchy design approval. Its badge styling is schematic
  and must not replace the actual shared badge components.
- 2026-09-14: Gift-hierarchy mockups are approved except for their broken mobile List composition;
  agents must not copy its grid-like stacking or prototype dimension script. Preserve genuine mobile
  List rows and shared crop geometry, retaining only necessary existing accessibility fallbacks for
  constrained/enlarged content. Verify the real mobile layout during implementation; this exclusion
  does not retain the design gate on #377.
- 2026-09-14: Keep manual reordering discoverable for eligible Card/List managers and recipients
  even with grouping active. Enter from the latest saved active/non-received order, temporarily
  bypass grouping/sorting/filters, explain the temporary view, and restore those browsing choices on
  Done without overwriting preferences or category/priority assignments. Grid/List switching stays
  available. Retain the top-left grip's small visible surface inside its larger hit target; approved
  mockups are not evidence that persistence, dragging, or positioning defects are fixed.

## Forms & settings

- 2026-05-30: Wishlist creation is a quick modal, not a route or wizard: required title, optional
  event date and palette, then navigate to the wishlist; richer settings stay on the wishlist.
- 2026-05-30: Gift viewing and create/edit use centered image-left, content-right dialogs that stack
  on mobile; avoid separate gift routes or inline expansion. Gift forms block saving while image
  upload authorization or upload is in progress. Auth pages are standalone branding/form split
  screens, and the landing page uses alternating feature-showcase sections.
- 2026-05-30: Sharing confirms consequences before method selection and success; explain current
  per-field rules, not the obsolete blanket lock. Methods use standard prefilled intent URLs such as
  WhatsApp and `mailto:`, not third-party sharing APIs. Manager invitations/revocation belong to
  contextual wishlist settings.
- 2026-05-30: Loading content uses skeletons, action failures use toasts, and field validation uses
  inline errors; preserve ordinary text selection rather than hiding a caret with
  `user-select: none`.
- 2026-07-08: Creation starts with “Pro mě” (default) / “Pro někoho jiného”; the latter reveals a
  required, trimmed recipient name, capped at 100 characters and autofocused. Explain manager
  reservation visibility, do not autofill the title, and do not request recipient email/account
  linking. Avoid obsolete copy claiming no later reassignment is possible.
- 2026-07-18: Gift edit/detail dialogs are wide with balanced image/form columns; the footer stays
  outside scrolling. The editor mode selector belongs above the image stage, source inputs remain
  with fields, and link rows label “Viditelný popisek” without a redundant “Hlavní” badge.
- 2026-09-01: Wishlist Details, Categories, Appearance, and Image/Crops share one staged draft and a
  global Save visible on every tab; save all dirty domains and close only after complete success.
  Palette previews are local until Save. Switching tabs preserves drafts without prompting.
- 2026-09-01: Closing/leaving settings, launching Import, or starting a Danger action with dirty
  settings offers Save and continue, Discard, or Continue editing. Import/Export and Danger remain
  immediate workflows, not staged fields. Category entry waits for fresh usage metadata, which stays
  live and separate from the draft without refetching on tab switches.
- 2026-09-01: Settings tabs stay in a fixed-height, shrink-proof area above body-only scrolling,
  ordered Details → Categories → Appearance → Image/Crops → Import/Export → Danger; equal-width
  desktop labels are centered, and narrow screens use one horizontally scrollable tab row.
- 2026-09-05: A color picker edits only its local draft until explicit Save; Cancel, Escape, outside
  dismissal, or becoming disabled discards changes. Invalid hex cannot commit and case-only
  differences are unchanged. Picker acceptance changes the parent draft, never bypasses global
  settings Save. Arbitrary hex/category swatches are separate from curated wishlist palettes.
- 2026-09-05: Keep palette choices compact and visually quiet; approval of the settings-control
  mockup covers picker behavior and save/loading/error lifecycle, not its simplified app shell,
  modal, or tabs. Keep modal action footers reachable and settings height stable across tabs.

## Visual design & component conventions

- 2026-05-30: `src/app.css` is the canonical design-token source; mockup token files are
  reference-only. Significant components have Svelte CSF Storybook stories, interaction `play`
  tests, autodocs, and variant grids; new derived/block components use `tailwind-variants`.
- 2026-05-31: Component folders and variants are lowercase, primary components/stories PascalCase,
  and compound subcomponents lowercase-prefixed. Extract `tv()` definitions into `*-variants.ts`,
  derive their types/constants there, and re-export through the public index.
- 2026-05-31: Use semantic component props: Button `intent`, Badge/Alert `tone`, and field/Card
  `state`, rather than calling everything `variant`. Keep custom Bits UI Select rather than a
  native-select fallback.
- 2026-07-10: The accepted Anime Sky redesign supplies ink borders, hard offset sticker shadows,
  notebook motifs, playful rotations, and spring-lift motion. Use the accepted mockups under
  `designs/redesign-2026/sky-final/`; earlier mockups inform structure, not superseded colors or
  styling.
- 2026-07-10: Primary buttons are flat `--brand-fill` stickers with ink border, hard shadow, and
  white text, not gradients/glow. Tape belongs only on paper artifacts. Gift image mats may pan on
  hover but remain static for reserved/received gifts; the large detail-dialog Like sticker is a
  specialized action, distinct from the later ghost-heart browse overlay.
- 2026-07-10: Headings use self-hosted DynaPuff and body text Geist, with Czech glyph coverage and
  metric-adjusted fallbacks. Light mode is the design source of truth; derive dark mode through
  tokens rather than independent mockups.
- 2026-07-10: One curated palette system replaces occasion presets, custom one-color themes,
  `data-accent`, and `data-bg-theme`. Palette primitives derive semantic tokens through CSS
  `color-mix(in oklab, …)`; wishlist palettes scope list identity while the viewer’s palette governs
  the rest of the app. The palette registry, not a duplicated name/count list here, defines
  available choices.
- 2026-07-10: Persist signed-in palettes on the user with a cookie mirror; anonymous preferences use
  a cookie. SSR sets `data-palette` before first paint. Light/dark/system is an independent per-user
  preference controlled by one cycling button, not multiple simultaneous icons.
- 2026-07-10: Motion uses shared duration/easing tokens and reduced-motion gating for hover lifts,
  wiggles, and staggered reveals; prefer component-library transitions where available rather than
  introducing a parallel animation system.
- 2026-07-18: Headings are semibold: page 26–34 px, dialog/section/empty-state 22 px, content card
  17 px, dense utility 14 px. Labels/help use 12 px muted text, with semibold labels and shared
  HelpText; `muted-foreground` is the single secondary-text role, not parallel subtle/ink-soft
  aliases.
- 2026-08-28: Motion represents visible continuity: only attached, rendered, nonzero elements
  visible before and after can supply travel coordinates. Filter insertion/removal appears at final
  coordinates with at most opacity; displaced visible siblings may FLIP, and cross-section travel
  requires the same gift visibly moving between visible sections.
- 2026-09-05: Dropdowns/submenus use always-sticky viewport containment, an 8 px collision margin,
  viewport-only height cap, and internal scrolling. The narrow Bits UI patch flips before
  unrestricted two-axis shift only for always-sticky layers; do not change partial-sticky behavior
  or extend it to Popover without evidence. Remove the patch when equivalent upstream behavior
  passes existing regression tests.
- 2026-09-06: Hover elevation keeps the native semantic button/anchor/trigger stationary as
  `.elevation-owner` and moves a direct `.elevation-surface`; a static strip covers the resting
  lower shadow. The approved Button/Select/ToggleGroup forwarding exception exposes this contract;
  inverse transforms, JS geometry synchronization, debounce, and removing elevation are not
  substitutes.
- 2026-09-12: Informational, reservation-reassurance, and trust-notice panels stay horizontal and
  use no tape treatment; do not tilt them into toolbar masks. Reserve playful rotation and tape for
  suitable decorative paper surfaces. A dialog close icon may rotate, but its shadow/surface must
  not rotate with it.
- 2026-09-12: Shadow/depth is a user appearance preference exposed in both profile settings and the
  global palette control, not a wishlist/category color. Apply its tokens consistently across
  controls and keep selected-option text legible in light/dark modes.
- 2026-09-14: Standardize control sizing and usage app-wide on `sm` 26 px, `md` 32 px, `lg` 40 px,
  and `xl` 48 px; controls default to `md` on desktop and `lg` on mobile, with explicit contextual
  variants rather than a separate mobile scale. Preserve `xl` calls to action, rows-driven
  textareas, and deliberate ghost-icon/dense-view exceptions with adequate hit targets. Buttons,
  single-line fields/selects, view-switcher segments, selection checkboxes, and notification/account
  triggers share contextual height, radius, and icon sizing; selection controls use button-sized
  visible surfaces. Preserve semantic primary/outline/ghost emphasis rather than forcing identical
  intent on neighboring controls.
- 2026-09-14: Equivalent adjacent-action groups use an 8 px gap on desktop and mobile; section
  spacing remains distinct. Align header brand/avatar outer visible edges, shell, hero, toolbar, and
  gift surfaces to the wishlist content container's centered max-width and 12 px mobile / 16 px
  desktop gutters, not internal notebook/form padding or shadow extents. Keep shadow depth
  consistent for the viewport/preference, allow additional clearance only where shadows require it,
  and separate accessible hit areas from visible geometry; nested corners follow `AGENTS.md`.
- 2026-09-14: Shared sizing variants own icon dimensions and consistent parent padding/insets,
  corner geometry, and shadow treatment; audit app-wide usage rather than patching individual call
  sites. Reuse shared components instead of new raw controls or one-off styling. Maintain a
  side-by-side component showcase with size rows and text/icon button treatments alongside fields,
  selects, checkboxes, switchers, and other compatible controls to expose regressions visually.
- 2026-09-14: Existing gift-card hover elevation moves the full visible card, including image,
  content, overlays, and actions, rather than an empty plate alone. Keep the card-level hover owner
  stationary, nested controls aligned with their visible hit targets, and lower-edge hover stable.
  Preserve existing motion timing, reduced-motion handling, and eligibility; do not add whole-card
  lift to flat List/Compact or ineligible dimmed states as part of this correction.
- 2026-09-14: Filter/sort/group changes must share the existing visible-identity reposition motion
  in Grid and List, with stale-run cancellation and reduced-motion handling. Keep Compact updates
  immediate and preserve the separate Grid/List crossfade, Compact view-switch behavior, drag,
  received-gift flight, and hover effects; this enhancement does not redesign those transitions.

- 2026-09-16: Dark palettes use near-charcoal page backgrounds, restrained hue-tinted surfaces, and
  darker primary fills with readable white labels; preserve light palettes and existing palette
  identities. Use `brand` for colored text/icons on dark surfaces and reserve `primary` with
  `primary-foreground` for filled controls. Tune the shared CSS derivation directly in the app
  before adding choices.

## Images & cropping

- 2026-05-29: Gift images support external image URLs and file uploads.
- 2026-06-02: Use one shared ImageFrame for fixed-size gift, wishlist, and avatar image boxes;
  wishlists store one `image_key` with independent per-slot crop metadata, not separate
  banner/thumbnail uploads.
- 2026-06-02: Focal point `{ x, y, zoom }` is canonical for rendering; persist normalized `cropRect`
  only to restore editing geometry. Do not render from cropRect or silently rewrite old image
  metadata.
- 2026-06-02: Crop zoom uses a styled native range input; a complex slider dependency is unnecessary
  for one continuous value.
- 2026-06-03: Pointer-only gift crop movement/resizing is an explicitly accepted accessibility gap
  (#50), not a claim of keyboard compliance; revisit keyboard operation and nested interactive
  handles if that deferral is reversed or an accessibility requirement demands it.
- 2026-07-12: Wishlist editor slots are `card`, `thumbnail`, and `social`; retain retired `banner`
  JSON without offering it. The header polaroid consumes the square thumbnail crop. Target aspect
  specifications live in `crop_targets.ts`, shared by editor, renderer, previews, and tests.
- 2026-07-13: Image editors expose Fill (`cover-crop`, centered), Fit (`contain-padded`, whole
  image), and Manual (per-target crops on `cover-crop`). Fit ignores stale manual targets; leaving
  Manual drops them on save. Legacy `auto` is not selectable and remains verbatim until the
  mode/image is actually changed.
- 2026-07-13: Manual zoom ranges from the target’s contain limit to 300%; its aspect-locked crop may
  exceed the source on one axis only (`min(w, h) ≤ 1`). Use exact focal/zoom geometry for
  letterboxing, not CSS scaling of an already clipped cover image; preserve oversized rects when
  restoring them.
- 2026-07-18: Gifts offer `square` (legacy name, now 4:3 grid-card crop) and `thumb` (1:1
  list/reservation crop), both WYSIWYG; `thumb` falls back to `targets.thumb ?? targets.square`
  without a migration. Retired `card`/`detail` target data remains readable but is not
  editor-offered. Keep persisted keys stable.
- 2026-07-18: “Karta” and “Seznam a rezervace” preview tiles are the only target switcher; clicking
  one or wheel-zooming a plain preview enters Manual. The adaptive stage contains the whole source
  photo with the active target window overlaid and overhang dimmed, not clipped; reuse its geometry
  for honest Fill/Fit previews instead of a parallel preview renderer.
- 2026-07-18: Visitor gift detail shows the uncropped photo at its natural aspect inside a height
  cap, not another crop target. Measuring an untouched legacy `auto` image may correct its presented
  Fill/Fit selection, but must neither dirty the form nor change persisted `auto` on save.
- 2026-08-26: Image-frame fill is separate from palette identity: offer white, black, or
  transparent/dotted mat for letterboxing, with the dotted/transparent choice as default. Do not
  revive the retired app-background theme axis to control image fill.

## Architecture, data & delivery

- 2026-05-30: Host within free-tier constraints on Cloudflare Workers, Neon Postgres through
  Hyperdrive, R2 image storage, and Resend email; provider quotas and operations belong in
  maintained runbooks rather than frozen comparisons with rejected hosts.
- 2026-05-30: SvelteKit remote functions are the default boundary: `query` reads, `form`
  progressive-enhancement mutations, `command` JS-only actions. Shared guarded wrappers derive
  authentication from the request; BetterAuth keeps its protocol routes. Purpose-specific HTTP
  endpoints are exceptions, not a general CRUD convention.
- 2026-05-30: Domain modules under `src/lib/modules/` own types, remote functions, typed
  `createContext` contexts, and public indices. Components separate managed base primitives,
  reusable derived wrappers, and feature blocks; base edits require a narrow approved exception, not
  casual feature styling.
- 2026-07-08: Preserve production data with additive schema evolution and reviewed row migrations;
  existing owner lists map to linked recipients and retain disclosed self-promotion. Never interpret
  an old “app is in development” note as permission to drop live data or rename persistent keys
  without migration planning.
- 2026-07-11: Authorize short-lived R2 PUTs server-side bound to exact key, type, length, and
  uploader; browser bytes go directly to R2 with restricted CORS. Same-origin upload proxying is
  local/fallback behavior when S3 credentials are absent, not the production default.
- 2026-07-11: Serve bounded image transformations for ordinary fixed-size surfaces with automatic
  original fallback; detail uses originals, including animated GIFs. Do not transform arbitrary
  external image URLs or multiply variants needlessly. Lazy/async loading is default except the
  eager header image.
- 2026-07-11: Owning mutations clean replaced/deleted images; abandoned pre-save uploads use
  uploader-bound delete tokens. Never offer arbitrary-known-key deletion or use lifecycle expiry
  that cannot distinguish referenced from orphaned objects.
- 2026-07-12: Mutation-owned `singleFlightRefresh` returns affected query updates in the command
  response; consume queries reactively rather than refresh-then-refetch. Dashboard surfaces refresh
  on opening, with throttled stale-while-revalidate nav previews, not after every gift mutation.
- 2026-07-12: Read stable locale/palette preferences together only for HTML document requests, not
  every remote/API/upload request. Commit in-app notifications durably before background email
  delivery through `runAfterResponse`; email failure logs and leaves delivery unsent without
  delaying the mutation. Keep request/statement budgets under regression tests.
- 2026-08-07: `/home` deliberately uses an authenticated server load and a server-only overview
  database service for typed SSR; do not replace it with eager/global fetch or an intra-server
  remote-function call merely to enforce the default convention.
- 2026-09-01: Gift mutations also refresh affected category-usage metadata in the same response; the
  older “gift-list query only” invalidation rule must not leave category-removal confirmations using
  stale assignments.

## Import, enrichment & production automation

- 2026-06-03: Import uses a shared Source → editable Review → Confirm wizard for creating a wishlist
  or appending gifts, with PapaParse, smart/manual column mapping, preamble/footer skipping, row
  selection, and duplicate hints by normalized name or link host/path.
- 2026-06-03: Accept CSV/TSV upload, pasted cells with HTML-table/TSV/CSV handling, and
  server-fetched Google Sheets export links; cap input at 200 rows / 1 MB. Explain
  private/non-tabular source failures; no Google OAuth/Drive Picker. Manual batch entry reuses the
  draft grid in a large dialog, not a separate route.
- 2026-06-03: Import creates gifts only, ignoring taken/reservation columns and cell colors. Users
  deselect unwanted rows; do not turn imported “taken” into anonymous reservations or received
  gifts.
- 2026-06-03: Link enrichment remains progressive, per-item, throttled, and offloaded behind a
  provider abstraction, rather than parsing/batch-scraping retailer HTML in the Worker. Import and
  manual batch entry do not depend on enrichment shipping. Linkless name search is deferred and must
  show candidates for confirmation; blank names stay blank with clickable links, never guessed from
  domains.
- 2026-08-09: The versioned gift-ingestion machine API is a fixed-actor, fixed-wishlist, add-only
  exception using a dedicated bearer token and shared transactional gift creation. Default to
  side-effect-free dry-run; durable run/item records provide audit and idempotency. No arbitrary
  destination, browser-cookie auth, general CRUD, SQL, environment selection, or infrastructure
  credentials in input.
- 2026-08-10: Ingestion prepares validated manifest/item/hash-bound uploads through short-lived
  exact-key/type/length presigned PUTs; the CLI checks HTTPS, DNS, every redirect, byte signatures,
  MIME, dimensions, and the gift-size limit before upload. Apply verifies R2 metadata and treats
  requested images all-or-nothing; dry-run and identical replay do no image I/O, cleanup touches
  only uncommitted staging and records failures.
- 2026-08-10: Follow `.agents/skills/add-gifts/SKILL.md` for evidence-ordered product extraction
  (JSON-LD, then page metadata, then exact brand/model search), no guessing or credential handling,
  mandatory dry-run, and apply only after an explicit unambiguous production request.

## Repository checks & operations

- 2026-05-29: No cookie-consent banner or dedicated GDPR UI is planned for the family-app scope;
  this is a UI scope choice, not a determination that legal obligations do not apply.
- 2026-05-30: Fallow is the dead-code tool, regression-gated in local/full checks and CI; stale
  suppressions are errors. Shared project conventions come from the installed MPX instructions, not
  copied or hard-coded historical `mpx-claude-code` rule inventories.
- 2026-09-06: Pre-commit uses lint-staged; pre-push prepares SvelteKit types then runs typechecking
  and Fallow in parallel through `check:prepush`, targeting under a minute rather than imposing a
  timeout. Compile Paraglide on a fresh checkout or catalog change. Full lint/tests belong to
  explicit verification and CI, not permission to skip failed gates.
- 2026-09-12: Feature PRs target `dev`; releases go through `dev` → `production`, exact-SHA checks,
  and production-environment approval. Follow `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`: expand → migrate → deploy →
  contract, file migrations with Drizzle strict mode, direct production verification, explicit
  authorization for pending migrations, and EXACT before deployment; drift blocks the operation and
  production never uses `db:push`.
